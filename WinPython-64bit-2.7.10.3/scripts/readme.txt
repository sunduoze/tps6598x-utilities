These batch files are not required to run WinPython.

The purpose of these files is to help the user writing his/her own
batch file to call Python scripts inside WinPython.
The examples here ('spyder.bat', 'spyder_light.bat', 'wpcp.bat',
'pyqt_demo.bat', 'python.bat' and 'cmd.bat') are quite similar to the
launchers located in the parent directory.
The environment variables are set-up in 'env.bat'.
