        Overview
        ======================================================================
        bbfreeze creates stand-alone executables from python scripts. It's
        similar in purpose to the well known py2exe_ for windows, py2app_ for
        OS X, PyInstaller_ and cx_Freeze_ (in fact ancient versions were based
        on cx_Freeze. And it uses the modulegraph_ package, which is also used by
        py2app).
        
        It has the following features:
        
        easy installation 
          bbfreeze can be installed with setuptools' easy_install command.
        
        zip/egg file import tracking
          bbfreeze tracks imports from zip files and includes whole egg files
          if some module is used from an eggfile. Packages using setuputils'
          pkg_resources module will now work (new in 0.95.0)
        
        binary dependency tracking
          bbfreeze will track binary dependencies and will include DLLs and
          shared libraries needed by a frozen program.
        
        multiple script freezing
          bbfreeze can freeze multiple scripts at once.
        
        python interpreter included
          bbfreeze will create an extra executable named 'py', which might be
          used like the python executable itself.
        
        automatic pathname rewriting
          pathnames in tracebacks are replaced with relative pathnames
          (i.e. if you import package foo.bar from /home/jdoe/pylib/
          tracebacks generated from functions in foo.bar will not show your
          local path /home/jdoe/pylib/foo/bar.py. They will instead show
          foo/bar.py)
        
        distutils command 'bdist_bbfreeze'
          A new distutils/setuptools command bdist_bbfreeze integrates
          bbfreeze into your setup.py.
        
        bbfreeze works on windows and UNIX-like operating systems. bbfreeze
        has been tested with python 2.4, 2.5, 2.6 and 2.7 bbfreeze will not
        work with python 3 or higher.

        Source
        -------------------
        Windows Eggs and the source code can be downloaded from 
        https://pypi.python.org/pypi/bbfreeze/.
        
        The source code is maintained in a git repository on github:
        https://github.com/schmir/bbfreeze
        
        Use::
        
          git clone https://github.com/schmir/bbfreeze.git
        
        to create a copy of the repository, then::
        
          git pull
        
        inside the copy to receive the latest version.
        
        
        
        Installation 
        ---------------
        You need to have setuptools/easy_install installed. Installation
        should be as easy as typing::
          
          easy_install bbfreeze
        
        This should download bbfreeze and it's dependencies modulegraph and
        altgraph and install them.
        
        Limitations
        ---------------
        - documentation is a bit sparse
        
        
        bbfreeze - command line tool
        ======================================================================
        bbfreeze provides a command line utility called bbfreeze, which
        freezes all python scripts given on the command line into the
        directory dist, which then contains for each script an executable and
        all dependencies needed by those executables.
        
        Example Usage::
        
          $ cat hello-world.py
          #! /usr/bin/env python
        
          import sys
          import email
        
          print unicode("hello", "utf8"), unicode("world!", "ascii")
        
          print "sys.path:", sys.path
          print "__file__:", __file__
          print "__name__:", __name__
        
          print "locals():", locals()
        
          print "sys.argv", sys.argv
          print "sys.executable:", sys.executable
          $ bbfreeze hello-world.py

        bdist_bbfreeze - distutils command
        ======================================================================
        
        bbfreeze provides a distutils command which works much like the
        'bbfreeze' command line tool, but integrates nicely into distutils
        and setuptools. It collects all 'console_scripts' 'gui_scripts'
        entry-points, generates the wrapper scripts (like easy_install would
        do) and freezes these scripts.
        
        After installing bbfreeze, every setup.py which used setuptools, has a
        new command 'bdist_bbfreeze'. To show the help message just run::
        
          python setup.py bdist_bbfreeze --help
        
        Usage examples::
        
          # freeze all scripts into ./dist/<egg_name>-<egg_version>/
          python setup.py bdist_bbfreeze
        
          # same, but use tagging for "daily build" or "snapshot" releases
          python setup.py egg_info --tag-build=dev bdist_bbfreeze
        
        
        
        bbfreeze - API
        ======================================================================
        The preferred way to use bbfreeze is by writing short python scripts,
        which use bbfreeze's API. Let's start with a short example::
        
          from bbfreeze import Freezer
          f = Freezer("hello-world-1.0", includes=("_strptime",))
          f.addScript("hello-world.py")
          f.addScript("hello-version.py")
          f()    # starts the freezing process
        
        
        `bbfreeze.Freezer(distdir="dist", includes=(), excludes=())`
        instantiates a Freezer object. It will create the frozen executables
        and dependencies inside the `distdir` directory. `includes` is a list
        or tuple of modules to include, `excludes` is a list or tuple of
        modules to exclude. Note that the freezer will *delete* the directory
        `distdir` before freezing!
        
        bbfreeze.Freezer objects have the following members:
        
        - `use_compression`: flag whether to use compression inside the created
          zipfile (default True).
        - `include_py`: flag whether to create the included python interpreter
          `py` (default True)
        - `addScript(path, gui_only=False)`: register a python script for
          freezing. `path` must be the path to a python script.
          The freezer will scan the file for dependencies and will create an
          executable with the same name in `distdir`. The `gui_only` flag only
          has a meaning on windows: If set, the executable created for this
          script will not open a console window.
        
        
        Recipes
        ----------------------------------------------------------------------
        Recipes provide a way to control the freezing process. Have a look at
        bbfreeze/recipes.py if you need to implement your own. Note that the
        API might change.
        
        
        Linux Notes
        ======================================================================
        The glibc version on the system used for freezing will generally be
        the minimum glibc version required to run the binaries.
        
        gtk, gdk, pango, glib shared libraries will not be copied by the
        freezing process. Those need a rather complicated runtime system and
        copying them would probably only lead to problems.
        
        Windows Notes
        ======================================================================
        binaries created with python 2.6 or 2.7 will need the Microsoft Visual
        C++ 2008 Redistributable Package (either the 32bit_ or the 64bit_
        version) installed on the target machine.

        -----------------------------------------------
        - bbfreeze has been split into bbfreeze-loader package and a pure
          python bbfreeze module. this should allow me to make more regular
          releases.
        - add recipe for lxml.etree
        - don't pollute module namespace while importing
        - don't pollute the modules namespace in EXTENSION_LOADER_SOURCE
        - make sure we use absolute imports in EXTENSION_LOADER_SOURCE
        - do not pick up bbfreeze/__main__.py when freezing bbfreeze/py.py
        - fix 'googlegroup subscribe' address
        - fix bdist_egg procedure when setuptools is not importable
        - fix the bdist_egg procedure when running under buildout

        - don't install PyXML as egg since it won't work
        - add addEntryPoint method
        - copy egg-info directories
        - rename bb-freeze to bbfreeze
        - rely on setuptools/distribute being installed
        - shorten and simplify extension loader
        - use absolute imports in the extension loader to load stdlib modules
        
        2012-10-23         release 1.0.2
        -----------------------------------------------
        - use altgraph 0.9 as 0.10 is incompatible
        
        2012-09-27         release 1.0.1
        -----------------------------------------------
        - update links to alternative freezers
        - skip libresolv.so, which is a part of glibc
        - call patchelf for anything which looks like a binary
        
        2012-02-08         release 1.0.0
        -----------------------------------------------
        - better test infrastructure
        - update documentation
        - remove bbfreeze.macholib
        - fix build on ubuntu 11.10
        - handle platform=='linux3' case in ensureRPath
        - make py recipe work again.
        - handle "pip -e" installed development eggs, that aren't even setuptools packages
        
        
        2011-04-12         release 0.97.3
        -----------------------------------------------
        - exclude ms-win-api-* and query.dll.
        - make py parse minimal set of options required to run py.test on the
          frozen executable.
        - link with /LARGEADDRESSAWARE on win32
        - ensure RPATH of application loader has the right value. try to fix
          it with patchelf if not.
        - set dont_write_bytecode and no_user_site flags if they are
          available.
        - handle pip installed namespace packages
        
        2010-10-12         release 0.97.2
        -----------------------------------------------
        - workaround console.exe not being executable.
        - switch to ez_setup.py from setuptools-0.6c11.
        - make win32com work by using a temporary directory as it's
          __gen_path__.
        
        2010-08-19         release 0.97.1
        -----------------------------------------------
        - add missing README.rst file.
        
        2010-08-17         release 0.97.0
        -----------------------------------------------
        - make it compatible with latest altgraph
        - add recipe for gevent
        - fix build on latest ubuntu
        
        2008-09-18         release 0.96.5
        -----------------------------------------------
        - added distutils command 'bdist_bbfreeze' contributed by Hartmut
          Goebel
        - executables are now stripped with the 'strip' command. This makes a
          difference in file size when using a static libpython.a.
        
        2008-8-29         release 0.96.4
        -----------------------------------------------
        - record previously missing dependencies for subpackage imports. This
          bug only showed up when dependencies where explicitly removed.
        
        2008-8-18	  release 0.96.3
        -----------------------------------------------
        - fix issues with some packages, which where wrongly
          recognized as development eggs
        
        2008-8-5	  release 0.96.2
        -----------------------------------------------
        - a slightly patched getpath.c from python trunk has been
          added. This should fix sys.getfilesystemencoding() for statically
          linked python. We also try to link with the static library in case
          the shared one has been linked with -Bsymbolic (which makes it
          impossible to override the necessary symbols). This happens e.g. on
          Ubuntu 8.04.
        - __file__ in the main program now has a .py suffix. This prevents
          garbage output from the warnings module.
        - some recipes have been added (mostly breaking some unneeded
          dependencies).
        - explicit recipes for the email module have been added. the email
          module isn't added as a whole.
        - the setup script now reports the configuration used.
        - bbfreeze now tracks dependencies from eggs (i.e. dependencies
          specified in the egg's setup.py script).
        
        
        2008-3-14         release 0.96.1
        -----------------------------------------------
        - fix bug in an internal function, which determines if eggs should 
          be used. It always returned False, so eggs where never packaged.
        
        2008-3-13         release 0.96.0
        -----------------------------------------------
        - some egg packages have the site-packages directory as their
          location, which resulted in the whole site-packages directory being 
          copied as some egg file.
        - fix issue with wxPython
        - add recipe for mercurial
        - handle development eggs ("python setup.py develop") by running
          setup.py bdist_egg
        - handle easy install entry scripts
        - add recipe for kinterbasdb (thanks to Werner F. Bruhin)
        - fix LD_RUN_PATH issue, when --enable--new-dtags is the default for
          linking (e.g. on gentoo). (thanks to Collin Day)
        
        2007-12-6         release 0.95.4
        -----------------------------------------------
        - workaround for virtualenv
        - show execution time in py
        
        2007-10-16        release 0.95.3
        -----------------------------------------------
        - recipes for pythoncom/pywintypes have been added
        - make sys.getfilesystemencoding() work like in non-frozen versions
        - automatic pathname rewriting
        - make stdin, stdout and stderr unbuffered in frozen programs
        
        
        2007-7-12       release 0.95.2
        -----------------------------------------------
        - fix issues with c modules with suffix 'module.so',
          e.g. zlibmodule.so, timemodule.so, ... (fedora core 7 uses that
          naming scheme; thanks to Neil Becker for reporting)
          The frozen executable did bail out with zipimport.ZipImportError:
          can't decompress data; zlib not available".
        
        2007-7-11       release 0.95.1
        -----------------------------------------------
        - compile .py files from eggs when there is no accompanying .pyc file
        - skip egg/zip files in find_all_packages (makes some recipes work)
        
        2007-7-6       release 0.95.0
        -----------------------------------------------
        - support for egg files: bbfreeze scans zipped egg files and now
          includes whole egg files/directories in the distribution. Programs
          using setuptools' pkg_resources module will now work (thanks to
          Eirik Svendsen for testing this).
        
        2007-6-28      release 0.94.1
        -----------------------------------------------
        - fix bug in setup script, now the patched modulegraph is really used
        - better recipe handling
        
        2007-6-22      release 0.94.0
        -----------------------------------------------
        - support relative imports (backported from modulefinder, bbfreeze now
          ships with its' own patched copy of modulegraph).
        - fix xml/_xmlplus issues
        - add recipe for cElementTree
